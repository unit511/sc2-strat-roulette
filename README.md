# sc2-strat-roulette
A C# application for selecting a random Starcraft 2 Co-op strategy.

The software can be downloaded by navigating to [releases](https://github.com/unit511/sc2-strat-roulette/releases), selecting the newest one and downloading the .exe file from the assets.

Source code is also included to make it easier to modify the possible strategies, it can be found in sc2-strat-roulette/Form1.cs.

There are still only a limited number of strategies, additional suggestions are appreciated.

Special thanks to the r/starcraft2coop community.

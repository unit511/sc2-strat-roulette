# sc2-strat-roulette
A C# application for selecting a random Starcraft 2 Co-op strategy.
Only the .exe file is needed for the program to run, everything else can safely be deleted (or not downloaded at all).
Source code is also included to make it easier to modify the possible strategies.
There are still only a limited number of strategies, additional suggestions are appreciated.
Special thanks to the r/starcraft2coop community.
